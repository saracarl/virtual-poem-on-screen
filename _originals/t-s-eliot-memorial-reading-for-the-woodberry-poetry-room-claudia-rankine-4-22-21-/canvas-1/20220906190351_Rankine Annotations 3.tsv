0:00:13	256	CD:Thank you and welcome to our second annual T.S. Eliot Memorial Reading made possible through the generosity of the T.S. Eliot Foundation. I am especially grateful to Claire Reihill and Judith Hooper and on this side of the pond to Blue Flower Arts to professor Gates’s staff members Amy Gosdanian and Terry Oliver and to Mary Walker Graham of the Poetry Room. I’m going to start with some brief opening remarks to allow some more people to enter the Zoom room and then I’ll hand the virtual mic over to Professor Henry Louise Gates Jr. who has so kindly agreed to provide an introduction to Claudia Rankine tonight. The Syrian poet Adonis has observed that there are thing that might not exist except through locution which is to say that certain words do not necessarily name something wholly extant or wholly as yet achieved but suggest something that might as Erica Hunt describes invent us more in the future or as Audre Lorde has written poetry is a vital necessity of our existence within which we predicate our hopes and dreams towards survival and change first made into language then into idea then into more tangible action, until the landscape of our words, as Edouard Glissant writes, becomes the landscape of our world. he Syrian poet Adonis has observed that there are thing that might not exist except through locution which is to say that certain words do not necessarily name something wholly extant or wholly as yet achieved but suggest something that might as Erica Hunt describes invent us more in the future or as Audre Lorde has written poetry is a vital necessity of our existence within which we predicate our hopes and dreams towards survival and change first made into language then into idea then into more tangible action, until the landscape of our words, as Edouard Glissant writes, becomes the landscape of our world. In Claudia Rankine’s book the word that is trying to become word is justice and also as she so powerfully and poignantly reveals it is us. When talking about what happens to us, who is us? What us? She cites a friend as saying by putting the words Just and Us side by Side, instead of fusing them into justice, Rankine is creating what one poet has called a, lang-wedge as in a wedge, a space, a breath, storying up that interval in which through which to forage a conversation. Conversation being something Rankine has come to define as attempting to stand in relation with our bodies and say it once I’m here and here a venturing of ones hand into that space toward what Fred Moten has called a grounded differing. Tonight’s event is itself such a space and I cannot think of anyone more capable of helping us stand in relation that Professor Henry Louise Gates Jr., director of the Hutchins Center for African and African American Studies and the Alfonze Fletcher University Professor at Harvard in addition to having authored or co-authored more than twenty books and creating twenty documentaries, you might also know him as the host of the PBS awarding winning program Finding Your Roots. What his title and resume might not tell you is in addition to his scholarly, civic, and artistic works he’s also been instrumental in his efforts to help build the collections of Harvard Libraries of which the poetry room is a small part through both his personal donations most recently of Harriet Wilson’s groundbreaking novel and through funds raised through Hutchins Center he has helped to acquire and provide access to the papers of Nobel Laureate Wole Soyinka, novelist Chinua Achebe and John Edgar Wideman, and poet June Jordan to name just a few. Please join me in welcoming the one the only professor Henry Louise Gates Junior who will introduce our honored guest this evening.	Transcription

0:04:18	483	HLG: My goodness, Christina, thank you! That was amazing. Not my part but the part about Claudia that was fantastic everybody round of applause please. So this evening it is my honor and enormous pleasure to introduce a person I admire and for whom I have enormous affection, Claudia Rankine, as she presents the TS Eliot Memorial reading a Woodberry Poetry Room here at Harvard University. Currently the Frederick Iseman Professor of Poetry at Yale within Departments of African American Studies and English. Born in Kingston JA (that’s Jamaica!) Rankine received her BA at Williams and MA at Columbia. The poet’s first collection of verse which I love Nothing in Nature is Private, published in 1994, won the Cleveland State Poetry Prize the first of many accolades and awards that her work would garner since then she’s published five more books of poetry and her 2014 publication Citizen: An American Lyric won both the Pen Open Book Award as well as the Pen Literary Award, the NAACP Image Award. Further Citizen holds the unique position of being the only book of poetry in history to be a New York Times Bestseller in the Nonfiction category—I love that—just as her brilliant poetry moves easily among genres, her writing encompasses several, including three plays, Help premiered March 2002 at The Shed in New York City, and in a joint production with Arts Emerson and our own American Repertory Theater, Rankine’s play White Card, which I actually saw and enjoyed enormously, was staged in 2018. As well her 3 plays Rankine has co-edited several anthologies including American Women Poets in the 21st Century, Where Lyric Meets language in 2002, and The Racial Imaginary Writers on Race and the Life of the Mind Published in 2015, and of course her own poems have been included in numerous anthologies including Great American Prose Poems from Poe to the Present. She’s also been part of numerous video collaborations. In 2016, Rankine co-founded the racial imaginary institute, funded in part by the proceeds from her 2016 MacArthur grant. As well as the Macarthur Genius Fellowship Grant, Rankine is the recipient of a 2017 Guggenheim Fellowship, The Bobbit National Prize for Poetry, and the poets and writers Jackson Poetry Prize. In addition, she’s been awarded fellowships and prizes from the Academy of American Poetry, The Lannan Foundation, and the National Endowment of the Arts among many, many others. Please welcome Claudia Rankine as she reads from her most recent publication, a brilliant publication called Just Us: An American Conversation. 	Transcription

496	529	Thank you, thank you, Professor Gates, Christina Davis, and everyone for spending this evening with me. I've been looking forward. I'm going to start by showing a video because why not? *She smiles and looks at the camera* And then I will read. So first I'm going to share the screen. That's always a point of anxiety...will this work 	Transcription + Embodiment

Officer 1 is a white, butch police officer in a pink shirt with a badge in her belt strap and a remote control in her hand. The room appears to be a basement with brown walls, one computer, a chair, a desk, a white board. Camera pans to a second officer, a Black man, in a suit and tie, the police chief. The camera pans again to a white woman looking at them. In Just Us, three stills from this video occur on page 138 (but of the objecting officer in the audience who is off screen) and Rankine transcribes the interaction using their names in the pages that follow. The section in the book is titled "white male privilege"	Cinematography + Environment
0:08:49	630	Off-screen male voice: Because if you can have a basis for where the number comes from and what the situation is that puts them in the situation. Officer 1: Mmmhhhmm Off-screen male voice: Are they more likely to be in this situation than someone who's not transgender? Officer 1: Mmhmm yes. Off-screen male voice: Which I don't know what that is, I'm just saying. My wife has never been part of police violence. Most of the people that I know have never been, accused the police of violence. So I guess I don't get where that's supposed to come from. Officer 1: It's a white male privilege so you wouldn't know. Off-screen voice: I'm sorry (angrily). I'm sorry?! (Repeated in voiceover) It's a white male privilege so you wouldn't know. Officer 1: I can end this right now, ok? Chief: We want to keep it safe and professiona;. That's my role and objective. So I don't want to focus on the statistics. Off-screen voice: CHIEF! Chief: Quite frankly. Off-screen voice: *interrupts* SERIOUSLY, I'M ASKING A LEGITIMATE QUESTION. And I've been taught white privilege are you serious? I find that extremely offensive. Voices overlap. Off-screen voice: In America?! I will leave. I file it on your desk. Chief: We're not talking about white privilege here. We're trying to focus on a different demographic. I'm going to keep this professional. And I apologize if anybody if offended. This data that we have here--	Transcription 
630	727	CR in Speaker view: OK, so when the white woman who told the police officer (she was also a police officer) that he couldn't understand why transgender people were targeted by the police  and she said you can't understand because of your white male privilege that woman was oput on leave and was given the position of no longer having any contact with anyone in the police force, so thats how she was to live out her time in the police force because she was a bad influence basically. And he the man who brought the charges against her for saying white male privilege, nothing ahappned to him. So that's that's the state of discourse in 2019. I don't know if things would have changed by now. But I wanted to begin with a quote from Paul Celan, he ssays, What times are these when a conversation is almost a crime? Because it includes so much made explicit. What times are these when a conversation is almost a crime? And with that I will start reading initially the openining poem from Just US.

967	1050	CR: I am, I wanted to start, many starts. I wanted to start by looking at some passages from Thomas Jefferson which is, you know, from notes on Virginia but in Just Us it's called Notes on the State of Whiteness and I love Jefferson because of how...contradictory he is, how human he is, (laughing), how capitalist he is, How, um, you know, on the one hand, he knows to incite people is not a good thing. On the other hand, he wants to have parties, and he needs somebody to help him out with that. (laughing) So..and he wants to buy wine, and he wants to buy paintings, and he takes out a mortage and the enslaved people are part of that mortage. So he cannot, he cannot free them. But it doesnt mean he doesn't know. It doesn't mean he doesn't know. So, I wanted to so I wanted to begin with the section, Their griefs are transient. 	Transcription
1051	1051	CR begins share screen of notes on the state of whiteness. The copy is a scan from Just Us that looks like a worn book, beginning on page 115 with the line: Their griefs are transient 	Cinematography
1055	1080	CR: You obviously know this is an erasure but I don't really see it as an erasure so much but as a document recreated to bring forward places in the text that might, um, be lost, um, by the words around them. 	Transcription
1081	1085	CR begins reading notes on the state of whiteness from page 115 in Just Us: Their griefs are transient 	Poem
1085	1133	And before I go on. I don't know how many of you watched the trials but the thing that struck me most was the number of ways in which different witnesses said you know it's too much, all of this is too much. And I try to stay in my body, or it's too much and it's upsetting to see somebody die. You know the defense is trying to claim that people are not capable of assessing what the police was doing because they were angry. And they're like, no, it's just upsetting to watch somebody be killed, be murdered.	Transcription
1135	1180	CR begins reading notes on the state of whiteness from page 115 in Just Us: Their griefs are transient 	Poem
1181	1247	After the line, In memory they are equal to whites in reason inferior, CR states: And and I feel like these thoughts by Jefferson are thoughts that the defense actually continued to make in the trial by insisting that people don't know what they see. So I have um, one of the things I did in this book is not everything is written but everything is forced in one way or another to meet the lyric. And so one of the poems in the book which I'll read is by James Baldwin from the White Man's Guilt but it wasn't it is not a poem but it was lineated by me into the lyric form. 	Transcription
1248	1349	CR reads: from James Baldwin's The White Man's Guilt, page 68 in Just Us	Poem
1350	1542	CR: And I'm going to stop sharing now, but one of things that has happened this week since it's only been two days since Chauvin was convicted is that I feel like many people and many of them white people want to put everything to rest with a decision that is, somebody called it an exception to the exception (CR laughs) and it's good that it happened but it has nothing to do with the system at large. We had a judge that claimed that Maxine Waters by calling for a response if justice wasn't served, um that would give the defense the ability to appeal, which they no doubt will appeal. And so, we can be pleased that something that should have been ordinary happened, but we can't be deluded into thinking that the system itself has been fixed by a single moment, a single exception. I just wanted to say that because it is. The piece that began Just Us was an essay written for The New York Times on talking to white men about white privilege. And, you know, I don't know why I started that but I, I thought it would be interesting to know what they were thinking since they control so much of my life. You know, the president of the college where I teach is a white man. There are white men who solicit me at the New York Times to work, all of them good people, I'm not saying anything against them personally, but, um, they are in some way in charge of my life. if we look to see who's in positions of power across the board, many of them are white men. So I t ought why not ask them about what they are thinking about all that they have. And so that's how I got myself into this essay, but I wanted to read just the section on the final conversation I had. 	Transcription
1375	1963	CR reads essay excerpt beginning on page 49 to page 53 of Just Us [Add hypothesis annotations of Springsteen + Commodore songs mentioned]: Not long after this I was on another flight and sitting next to a white man who felt as if he could already be a friend...	Essay excerpt 
1965	2049	That response that he gave me. I mean the part of it that I find the most moving actually is when he said, "I realize that I had misrepresented something I said to you about my hometown. I don't know why. I certainly hadn't done it intentionally and I realized I thought I was being honest in the moment." And so this, the way in which our white supremacist foundational orientation, acculturation, whatever you want it to call it, doesn't allow white people to understand even why they do the things they do, to shield themselves from their own fantasies in order not to have to apprehend the realities in front of them is something that continutes to interest me in a way, and sort of was the driving force in just us. I am going to end by reading a page from the end of the book. (Sound of pages turning)	Transcription
2050	2391	CR reads the prose poem beginning on page 329 in Just Us: Fantasies cost lives. Ending on the line: What would white people have to graft onto their fantasies so they can treat as real the possibility of true change? True equality? Then skipping sections on the voter demographics by race of the 2008 election. To read on page 331: Reimagining agency is the conversation I want to have. Concluding the reading, CR skips from, There is no beyond of citizenship, to another sentence on the final page 335: Our lives could enact a love of close readings of who we each are, the love of a newly formed, newly conceived "one" made up of obscure but sensed and unnamed publics...and reads to the end of the last page. CR: Thank you. 	Poem

So please unmute your mics and say hello. Audience: Many many many many thank yous overlapping, incredible, so glad I got to be here. HLG: I'm sorry we can't take you for dinner at Benedetto's.
