I am especially grateful to Claire Reihill and Judith Hooper and on this side of the pond to Blue Flower Arts to professor Gates’s staff members Amy Gosdanian and Terry Oliver and to Mary Walker Graham of the Poetry Room. I’m going to start with some brief opening remarks to allow some more people to enter the Zoom room and then I’ll hand the virtual mic over to Professor Henry Louise Gates Jr. who has so kindly agreed to provide an introduction to Claudia Rankine tonight. The Syrian poet Adonis has observed that there are thing that might not exist except through locution which is to say that certain words do not necessarily name something wholly extant or wholly as yet achieved but suggest something that might as Erica Hunt describes invent us more in the future or as Audre Lorde has written poetry is a vital necessity of our existence within which we predicate our hopes and dreams towards survival and change first made into language then into idea then into more tangible action, until the landscape of our words, as Edouard Glissant writes, becomes the landscape of our world. he Syrian poet Adonis has observed that there are thing that might not exist except through locution which is to say that certain words do not necessarily name something wholly extant or wholly as yet achieved but suggest something that might as Erica Hunt describes invent us more in the future or as Audre Lorde has written poetry is a vital necessity of our existence within which we predicate our hopes and dreams towards survival and change first made into language then into idea then into more tangible action, until the landscape of our words, as Edouard Glissant writes, becomes the landscape of our world. In Claudia Rankine’s book the word that is trying to become word is justice and also as she so powerfully and poignantly reveals it is us. When talking about what happens to us, who is us? What us? She cites a friend as saying by putting the words Just and Us side by Side, instead of fusing them into justice, Rankine is creating what one poet has called a, lang-wedge as in a wedge, a space, a breath, storying up that interval in which through which to forage a conversation. Conversation being something Rankine has come to define as attempting to stand in relation with our bodies and say it once I’m here and here a venturing of ones hand into that space toward what Fred Moten has called a grounded differing. Tonight’s event is itself such a space and I cannot think of anyone more capable of helping us stand in relation that Professor Henry Louise Gates Jr., director of the Hutchins Center for African and African American Studies and the Alfonze Fletcher University Professor at Harvard in addition to having authored or co-authored more than twenty books and creating twenty documentaries, you might also know him as the host of the PBS awarding winning program Finding Your Roots. What his title and resume might not tell you is in addition to his scholarly, civic, and artistic works he’s also been instrumental in his efforts to help build the collections of Harvard Libraries of which the poetry room is a small part through both his personal donations most recently of Harriet Wilson’s groundbreaking novel and through funds raised through Hutchins Center he has helped to acquire and provide access to the papers of Nobel Laureate Wole Soyinka, novelist Chinua Achebe and John Edgar Wideman, and poet June Jordan to name just a few. Please join me in welcoming the one the only professor Henry Louise Gates Junior who will introduce our honored guest this evening.",

So this evening it is my honor and enormous pleasure to introduce a person I admire and for whom I have enormous affection, Claudia Rankine, as she presents the TS Eliot Memorial reading a Woodberry Poetry Room here at Harvard University. Currently the Frederick Iseman Professor of Poetry at Yale within Departments of African American Studies and English. Born in Kingston JA (that’s Jamaica!) Rankine received her BA at Williams and MA at Columbia. The poet’s first collection of verse which I love Nothing in Nature is Private, published in 1994, won the Cleveland State Poetry Prize the first of many accolades and awards that her work would garner since then she’s published five more books of poetry and her 2014 publication Citizen: An American Lyric won both the Pen Open Book Award as well as the Pen Literary Award, the NAACP Image Award. Further Citizen holds the unique position of being the only book of poetry in history to be a New York Times Bestseller in the Nonfiction category—I love that—just as her brilliant poetry moves easily among genres, her writing encompasses several, including three plays, Help premiered March 2002 at The Shed in New York City, and in a joint production with Arts Emerson and our own American Repertory Theater, Rankine’s play White Card, which I actually saw and enjoyed enormously, was staged in 2018. As well her 3 plays Rankine has co-edited several anthologies including American Women Poets in the 21st Century, Where Lyric Meets language in 2002, and The Racial Imaginary Writers on Race and the Life of the Mind Published in 2015, and of course her own poems have been included in numerous anthologies including Great American Prose Poems from Poe to the Present. She’s also been part of numerous video collaborations. In 2016, Rankine co-founded the racial imaginary institute, funded in part by the proceeds from her 2016 MacArthur grant. As well as the Macarthur Genius Fellowship Grant, Rankine is the recipient of a 2017 Guggenheim Fellowship, The Bobbit National Prize for Poetry, and the poets and writers Jackson Poetry Prize. In addition, she’s been awarded fellowships and prizes from the Academy of American Poetry, The Lannan Foundation, and the National Endowment of the Arts among many, many others. Please welcome Claudia Rankine as she reads from her most recent publication, a brilliant publication called Just Us: An American Conversation. ",

On the other hand, he wants to have parties, and he needs somebody to help him out with that. (laughing) So..and he wants to buy wine, and he wants to buy paintings, and he takes out a mortage and the enslaved people are part of that mortage. So he cannot, he cannot free them.

We had a judge that claimed that Maxine Waters by calling for a response if justice wasn't served, um that would give the defense the ability to appeal, which they no doubt will appeal. And so, we can be pleased that something that should have been ordinary happened, but we can't be deluded into thinking that the system itself has been fixed by a single moment, a single exception. I just wanted to say that because it is. The piece that began Just Us was an essay written for The New York Times on talking to white men about white privilege. And, you know, I don't know why I started that but I, I thought it would be interesting to know what they were thinking since they control so much of my life. You know, the president of the college where I teach is a white man. There are white men who solicit me at the New York Times to work, all of them good people, I'm not saying anything against them personally, but, um, they are in some way in charge of my life. if we look to see who's in positions of power across the board, many of them are white men. So I t ought why not ask them about what they are thinking about all that they have. And so that's how I got myself into this essay, but I wanted to read just the section on the final conversation I had. ",
