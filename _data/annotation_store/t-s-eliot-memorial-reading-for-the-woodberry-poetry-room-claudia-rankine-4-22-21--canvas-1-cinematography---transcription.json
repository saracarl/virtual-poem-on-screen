And he the man who brought the charges against her for saying white male privilege, nothing ahappned to him. So that's that's the state of discourse in 2019. I don't know if things would have changed by now. But I wanted to begin with a quote from Paul Celan, he ssays, What times are these when a conversation is almost a crime? Because it includes so much made explicit. What times are these when a conversation is almost a crime? And with that I will start reading initially the openining poem from Just US. ",
