Officer 1 is a white, butch police officer in a pink shirt with a badge in her belt strap and a remote control in her hand. The room appears to be a basement with brown walls, one computer, a chair, a desk, a white board. Camera pans to a second officer, a Black man, in a suit and tie, the police chief. The camera pans again to a white woman looking at them. In Just Us, three stills from this video occur on page 138 (but of the objecting officer in the audience who is off screen) and Rankine transcribes the interaction using their names in the pages that follow. The section in the book is titled \"white male privilege\"",
